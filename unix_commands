PERMISSIONS #
Either (r)ead, (w)rite, or e(x)ecute on 'user', 'group', 'others'

Example:
-rw-r--r--
User can read and write, group and others can only read

The first column can either be
- regular file
d directory
l symlink

# WILDCARD #
The '*' can be used as a wildcard:

ls *.fasta
List anything that ends with .fasta

But this also works:
ls *[0-9].fasta		List anything that ends with number.fasta
ls *[3-5][5]0.fasta	List anything that ends with 350, 450, 550

# GENERAL TERMINAL HOTKEYS #

Ctrl-A		 Jump to the start of the line
Ctrl-E		 Jump to the end   of the line
Ctrl-K		 Remove everything between cursor and end   of line (K is for KILL)
Ctrl-U		 Remove everything between cursor and start of line
Ctrl-W		 Remove word where cursor is currently (W is for WORD)
Ctrl-Y		 Paste the last thing you removed with Ctrl-K or Ctrl-W or Ctrl-U (Y is for YANK)
Ctrl-L		 Same as 'clear'
Ctrl-D		 Same as 'exit'
Ctrl-x-e 	 Open up in-terminal editor (emacs / vim) and write multi line command.
			 Exiting the editor will then execute the command

!$			Bang-Dollar. Wildcard for the last argument of the previous command
Esc-.		Will return the last argument of the previous command
			Esc could be Alt in other systems
Esc-Bksp	Remove everything between special character (_./\) and cursor
Esc-F		Move forward   one word in the command line
Esc-B		Move backwards one word in the command line


# SYSTEM #

lscpu		Reports the number of cpus, architecture, and all other relevant CPU information of the system

# SHELL SCRIPTING #

sh, bash, Perl, Python, Ruby etc are scripting languages in which the "program" is a regular file containing plain text that is interpreted into MACHINE CODE at the time you run it. Other languages like c++, java, haskell, rust have a separate
COMPILATION step to turn their regular text source file into a BINARY EXECUTABLE.

A script from sh, bash, Perl, Python, Ruby etc become EXECUTABLE simply by turning on the executable permission.

& SHEBANG &

#!/bin/bash		Allows the script interpreter to recognize that the file should be executed with bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash	Same, but now the script is portable. I.e., different systems will recognize it as a bash script
	       		The env program will find the bash that is found in your environment
#!/usr/bin/env python3	Use the python3 that is found by the environment

& VARIABLES &

Everything in UNIX is case sensitive. So $NAME ne $name ne $Name
Probably a good idea to use lower case variable names in scripts, so not to accidentally overwrite environment variables

& SET -U &

Analogous to 'use warnings' in perl?
Write 'set -u' on top of your shell script

& REDIRECTING &

program 2> file.e   Redirect STDERR to file.e
program 1> file.o   Redirect STDOUT to file.o
program 1> file.o 2> file.e Redirect STDOUT to file.o and STDERR to file.e
program 2>/dev/null   Redirect output to /dev/null , where data is gone forever

& LOOP STUFF &

IF LOOP SYNTAX
if []; then
   ...
else
   ...
fi

NESTED FOR LOOPS
for i in {};
do
    for j in {};
    do cmd $i $j;
    done;
done;

FOR LOOPS

for i in {<word>,<word>,<word>}; do cmd1 $i; cmd2; done
sometimes $i needs to be written as ${i}, for example when '_' follows $i directly

for i in *.txt; do cmd; done
Loops over all files that match the *.txt pattern.

WHILE READ LOOP
Read a file line by line and assign variables to the line's content.

Example:
ls -la | while read PERM USR USRGRP SIZE; do
   echo $PERM $USR $USRGRP $SIZE;
done

while read -r LINE; do
      echo "$LINE"
done < "$FILE"

Use the read '-r' flag, 'while read -r STRING' to prevent read from eating '\' in $STRING

LOOP CONTROL
break		Breaks and leaves the loop 
continue	Skip to the next iteration of the loop (definitely analogous to next of Perl)

LOOP OVER RANGE OF NUMBERS
for i in {89..97..2}; do
    echo $i
done

loops from 89 to 97 with steps of 2

Will return
89
91
93
95
97

& COMPARING STUFF &

COMPARE TWO STRINGS
if [ "$S" -ge "$Q" ] ...

SHELL BOOLEANS FOR INTEGERS
-eq   Equal
-ne   Not Equal
-gt   Greater Than
-lt   Lesser Than
-ge   Greater or Equal then
-le   Lesser or Equal then

STRING COMPARISON OPERATORS
=     Match
!=    Does not match

Example:
Checks if the string "BACL10" is part of $alphabin

if [[ "$alphabin" != *"BACL10"* ]]; then
   echo "blastp $alphabin ..."
fi

OTHER COMPARISONS
[[ -e FILE ]]	     True if FILE exists
[[ -f FILE ]]	     True if FILE exists and is a regular file
[[ -h FILE ]]	     True if FILE exists and is a symbolic link
[[ -s FILE ]]	     True if FILE is non-empty
[[ -d DIR ]]	     True if DIR exists
[[ -z $STRING ]]     True if $STRING is null (doesn't exist)

&& is used to chain commands together, such that the command after the && is only run when the command prior to the && is run without any errors
&& is also used to mean AND in comparisons that return True/False

Example
[[ ! -d "$OUT_DIR" ]] && mkdir -p "$OUT_DIR"
if $OUT_DIR does not exist is TRUE, create $OUT_DIR


Alternatively

# if file with orig.tsv extension exists
if ls *.orig.tsv 1> /dev/null 2>&1; then ... ; fi

# if pattern does NOT exist in file.list
if ! grep -q $pattern file.list; then ... ; fi

& BASH SCRIPT STUFF &
POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS FOR BASH SCRIPT
$0	  Name of the bash script
$1	  First argument
$2	  Second argument
$3	  Etc etc..
$@	  All the arguments in a single string
$#	  The number of positional arguments (not including the name of the script)

If multiple words on the command line are flanked by quotes, whatever is within the quotes is one positional argument
./script.sh ONE TWO "THREE PIGS"
$1 -> ONE
$2 -> TWO
$3 -> THREE PIGS

CASE
Matches a variable against a range of options described in the case loop

Example:
var=apple
case $var in
    apple)
	echo "variable was apple";;
    pear)
	echo "variable was pear";;
    mango)
	echo "variable was mango";;
esac
Will print "variable was apple"

GETOPTS
Stating options in a bash script. Only works with one letter flags.

while getopts ":s:m:z:n:t:g:" opt; do
    case $opt in
        s) alignment=${OPTARG};;
        m) model=${OPTARG};;
        z) treelist=${OPTARG};;
        n) treenames=${OPTARG};;
        t) threads=${OPTARG};;
        g) guidetree=${OPTARG};;
        *) usage;;
	:) echo "Option -${OPTARG}" requires an argument; exit 1;; 
	\?) echo "Error: Invalid option: -${OPTARG:-""}; exit 1"
    esac
done

The : after the single letter in the getopts line, states that it expects an argument after the flag. I.e. -s bladiebla.aln
The first : in that line prevents 'verbose error handling'
:)  gets activated when an option/flag that needs an argument is called without an argument
\?) gets activated when an option/flag that is not specified in the code is called.

& REST STUFF &
USING DELIMITER OTHER THAN WHITESPACE:
grep -c ">" foo.fasta | while IFS=':' do
     echo $FILE $SEQCOUNT;
done

& STRING CONTROL &
i=teststring
echo $i			returns "teststring"
echo ${i}		returns "teststring"
echo ${i%string}	returns "test"
echo ${i%string}var	returns "testvar"
echo ${i#test}		returns "string"
echo ${i/string/button} returns "testbutton"

& SOME OTHER STRING SYNTAX &

string=${var:-default}	$string gets value $var if $var is set previously. Otherwise, $string gets set to the text "default"
arg=${1:-'srr.txt'}	Sets arg to $1 (the positional argument) if $1 is set. Otherwise, arg gets set to the text 'srr.txt'

& ARITHMATIC &

sum=$((1+1))	$((1+1)) returns to 2, prior to assigning sum the value 2	
let sum=1+1	$sum is assigned the value 2 through simple arithmetic evaluation 
$i=$(($i + 1)) is synonymous to let i++

& BASH ARRAYS &
declare -A arr				Declare a new array arr
arr=()	   				Empty/reset arr
arr=( ["moo"]="cow" ["woof"]="dog")	Create a dictionary/hash. Supported since bash v4. Make sure to use #!/bin/bash and not #!/bin/sh
while read -r one two;
do
	arr[$one]="$two"
done < input_file			Fill up an array/dictionary/hash by reading in a file. It seems critical to have the file read in like this: done < input_file
echo "${!arr[@]}"			Return the KEYS of the dictionary
echo "${arr[@]}"			Return the VALUES of the dictionary

& PROCESS SUBSTITUTION &
join <(sort FILE1) <(sort FILE2) > FILE3
<(sort FILE) obsoletes an intermediate file, it creates like a temporary file within the command.
Otherwise you would have done:
sort FILE1 > FILE1-sort
sort FILE2 > FILE2-sort
join FILE1-sort FILE2-sort > FILE3
rm FILE1-sort
rm FILE2-sort
So it saves you a lot of work! Amazing!!

& REDIRECT OUTPUT &

cmd > file.txt		Write STDOUT to file.txt
cmd >> file.txt	 	Append file.txt with STDOUT
cmd &> file.txt		Write STDOUT and STDERR to file.txt

& EXIT STATUS &

Every command in Unix returns an exit status. A successfull exit status returns 0, an un-succesfull one returns a non-zero value. The last command executed determines the exit status.
Within a script, when exiting, you can pass on a custom exit status through
exit <nnn>, where nnn is an integer between 0 and 255

The special variable $? holds the exit status.
echo $? to check it

# ENVIRONMENT STUFF #

export VARIABLE="FOO"  # set "FOO" as environment variable VARIABLE
unset VARIABLE         # remove variable VARIABLE from environment

All environment variables are uppercase !

& SPECIAL VARIABLES &

$PATH	Contains all directories that contain executables that can be directly invoked from the command line
$HOME	Contains the absolute home directory
$PWD	Contains current absolute directory
$USER	The username
$SHELL	The program running the current shell


# UNIX PROGRAMS #

ALIAS
alias		Returns all active aliases

To add default aliases, write in your .bashrc or .profile files
alias=<cmdalias>='<cmd>'
Example:
alias l='ls -la'

UNALIAS
unalias <alias>	Remove <alias> from alias list

AT
Execute a bash script at a given time
Example:
at -f <commands.sh> 21.00

AWK
awk 'PREDICATE {CODEBLOCK}'

awk '$3 >= 98 {print $0}' <file> > <out>	If the 3rd field is greater than or equals 98, print line
awk '{ for(i=1;i<=NF;i++){ print $i}}'		Merge multiple columns into single column
awk -F ":" '{}'		   	 		Set : as field seperator. Default FS (Field Separator) space and tab characters. Does not work with single quotes.
awk -F "\t"					Sets only tab as field separator
awk 'OFS="\t" {print $3,$1,$2}'			Sets Output Field Separator to tab. In print statement use commas!
awk '$3 >= 0.3 && $5 >= 0.3 {print $0}'		Requires that the 3rd AND the 5th field are above 0.3
awk 'NR>2'  NR = Number of Record  		By default, NR is the line number

# Only print line numbers (Number Records) 3 and higher
l | awk 'NR>2'

awk -v i="$i" -v j="$j" '$3 >= i {print $0, "\t", j}'
Pass on the shell variables $i and $j to awk
(otherwise awk will think $i is the ith column)
NOTE: within the '{}' part of the awk statement, do not use $i, but simply 'i'

NOTE: When filtering columns for fractions, i.e. $7 > 0.3, make sure that the input files decimal separators are DOTS, not COMMAS !!

awk '{print $2 "\t" $1}'			Switch columns

NR		= Number of total records (default => record is one line)
FNR 		= Number of file records
map[$1] = $2 	= awk array (like a perl hash)

BASENAME
Trims paths and extensions froms strings (opposite of DIRNAME)

Example:
          FASTA      returns	panorthologs/famcl00140.faa
basename $FASTA      returns 	famcl00140.faa
basename $FASTA .faa returns 	famcl00140

see also DIRNAME

BC
Calculator
echo "100/50" | bc		Yields 2
echo "scale=2:100/60 | bc -l	Yields 1.67

-e	Show newline characters as '$'
-A	Show tabs (^I), newline characters ($) and other non-printing characters (^ + ascii char). Option does not exist in macOS
-t	Show tabs (^I), newline characters ($) in macOS.
-n	Print line numbers

Neat trick:
cat > new_file
Then type whatever texts you want to type
End with Ctrl-D
You now have a new file with the typed content!

COLUMN
column -t [file]	Prints the file so that all columns are nicely aligned in view
column -t [file] -s $'\t' Use TAB as separator instead of the default whitespace
You can also type 'Ctrl-v TAB' while typing the comment. "

CHMOD
Change rights of owner / user, group, others or all of a file to either read, write or execute.
Example:
chmod u+x <file>	Adds the e(x)ecutable right for (u)ser to this <file>
chmod ug+x <file> Add executable rights to user and group
chmod u-x <file>  Remove executable rights for user
chmod 755 <file>  7=4+2+1=r+w+x for user. 7=4+2+1=r+w+x for group. 5=4+1=r+x for others
chmod 600 <file>  6=4+2=r+w for user, 0=--- for group, 0=--- for others

CHOWN
Change ownership of a given directory
Example:
chown kasiazar kasia/
-R    Recursive (any directory below will also be changed ownership)

COMM
Compares to files and lists the common lines and unique files
Files have to be sorted first (in the same way ofcourse)
Column1: unique to file1      	  '-1' to suppress this column
Column2: unique to file2	  '-2' to suppress this column
Column3: appear in both files	  '-3' to suppress this column

CP
cp -P	Copy a symbolic link

CONVERT
Converts between image file formats
Example:
convert                 filename.pdf filename.png
convert -resize 200x100 filename.pdf filename.png	Resizes the image while converting
convert -resize 200     filename.pdf filename.png	Resizes the image to 200px wide, but keeps aspect ratio for length

CRONTAB
-l	List all current crontabs
-e	Edit crontab commands
crontab command format:
[minute] [hour] [day of the month] [week] [month] [day of the week]

CUT
cut <flags> <file>		Remove sections from lines
-f <number or list>	       	Select column <number>
   	      		       	Example: 3. Or 1,3,4. Or 1-5. Or 1-3,5-7
-d <delim>		       	Select delimiter to use to creat fields,
   			       	Example: '_' or ' '. Default is '\t' ?
-d\'					Set literal single tick as delimiter
--complement		       	Prints all fields except those specified in -f
cmd | rev | cut -f 1 | rev	Trick to print the last column. Be ware: you may need to put cut -f 2 instead.

DATAMASH
datamash -s -g 1 collapse 2
A 1
A 2
B 3
C 4
D 5
D 6

into

A 1,2
B 3

DIRNAME
Trims filenames from strings (opposite of BASENAME)

Example:
	 FILE	     returns	/path/to/panorthologs/famcl00140.faa
dirname $FILE	     returns 	/path/to/panorthologs

DNSDOMAINNAME
dnsdomainname	Reveals the domain name of the current computer where you are logged in
		Example: icm.uu.se

DU					Reports disk usage of directories or files
-h <file|directory>			Human readable numbers
du -h . | sort -h -r | head -n 20	Nice quick command to look for the top biggest directories from current directory
du -sh <dir>  	       	       		Report total size of dir only. Will not report any nested directories or files

ECHO
echo "$STRING"	Prints string to STDOUT
echo $STRING	Same thing but converts tabs to spaces

Options:
-e	Enables interpretation of backslash escapes and certain characters are recognized, like \t and \n
-n	Removes the newline character

EVAL
Takes a string as an argument and evaluates it as if you'd typed that string on a command line

EXIT
exit <n>	Exit with an exit code. Any non-zero exit code will be interpreted as exited with an error.

FIND
find <PATH> <flags> \;
-name <EXPRESSION>
-maxdepth <number>		The level of directories down find will try to find your attern
-size 0
-exec <cmd> {}			{} refers to each file that was found
-xtype l    			Find broken symlinks

Example:
find . -name "All.htm"
find . -size 0 -exec rm {} \;	Remove empty files
find . -xtype l -exec rm {} \;	Remove broken symlinks

FG
Bring back jobs that are running in the background, into the "foreground". Jobs that are running in the background can be displayed with "jobs"
Ctrl-Z to put current windown in the background. Then you can use 'fg' to put it back to the foreground

GREP
grep "PATTERN" <file> OUTPUTS THE ENTIRE LINE OF WHERE IT FINDS ITS HITS
grep -v "^$"   	      REMOVES EMPTY LINES
     		      (no special character, but clever use
		      of regexp: ^ start of line, $ end of line)
Flags:
-i			Ignores case
-n			REPORTS LINE NUMBER OF HITS
-c			COUNTS HITS
-c ""			Counts lines in the file
-A <int>	       	PRINTS IN ADDITION TO HIT LINE ALSO int LINES AFTER HIT
-v 		       	PRINTS ALL LINES EXCEPT LINES WITH HITS
-P		       	Allows for Perl regexp in PATTERN
-f <FILE>	       	Prints all lines that have the PATTERNS listed in FILE, one per line
-x 		        The PATTERN must encompass the entire line. Handy for speeding up grep
--no-group-separator	Suppresses the '--' seperator when using -A, -B, or -C
-o			If you have multiple hits in a single line, it will report all the hits on that line, seperated by newlines.
			It will not report the whole line, but just the match. Hence the name '-only_matching'
--color=always		Keep coloring of match even if you pipe into a new grep command. Even less keeps color
			Can even do 2 different colors. Example
			echo "hello" | grep --color=always "he" | GREP_COLORS="mt=01;34" grep "lo"
-e			Multiple search patterns at the same time. grep -e "pattern1" -e "pattern2"
-m <NUM>		Only reports the first <NUM> lines with match
-H 			Always reports the filename that it found its hit in
-q			Quiet mode

AGREP
Grep that allows mismatching. Very handy to search sequence data still allowing sequence errors
--color
-E <NUM>	Allowed <NUM> of mismatches

HOSTNAME
hostname	Reveals the name of the host
		Example: molev209

IDENTIFY
Reports properties of an image file. Part of the ImageMagick suite.
Example:
identify filename.png

Reports:

filename.png PNG 200x3510 200x3510+0+0 16-bit DirectClass 1.267MB 0.000u 0:00.000

JOBS
Lists all 'jobs', that can either be commands, or scripts or anything like that in the background. Putting an '&' sign after the job command puts it in the background. With FG (foreground), you put the 'job' back in the foreground. Then you can kill it for example. JOBS only lists those jobs that are running in that specific terminal

JOIN
Join two files based on a common field between two files to create a new, merged file

join -a 1 -a 2 -e '0' -1 2 -2 2 -o '1.1,2.1,0' -t $'\t' FILE1 FILE2 > FILE3

-a 1 -a 2      	  Switch to print unpairable fields of FILE1 and FILE2
-e '0'	       	  Replace missing fields with 0 (if a column value exists in FILE1 and not in FILE2 or vice versa)
-1 2		  Join using the 2nd field in file 1
-2 2		  Join using the 2nd field in file 2
-o '1.1,2.1,0'	  Print the field 1 of file 1, field 1 of file 2, and the field used to join them (0 special meaning)
-t $'\t'	  Set field delimiter. Tab is default, but by setting this explicitly, Tab becomes the delimiter in the output too

NOTE: FILE1 and FILE2 need to be sorted (on their common field) prior to attempting to join!

KILL
Killing defunct processes. For example when Firefox crashes
ps -e | grep firefox
kill -9 <process_id_of_firefox>

LESS
/PATTERN
Search for regex pattern in file from this point on forward
?PATTERN
Search for regex pattern in file from this point on backwards
Press 'n' to go to the next hit
Press 'N' to go the previous hit
<number> then g	    Go to line <number>

Flags:
-S		Show file without line breaks
-N		Show line numbers
+F 		

LN
Symbolic links
ln -s <source> <link name>	Places a link to another file (so prevents additional space to be used)
ln -s <source> 	     		Automatically clips the path and only leaves the file name as the name of the link

LS
ll -Sh		Sorts all files in directory by size and displays human readable file sizes

MAN
man -l <file>	Will open the file with man
man ./		Will open the file with man

MKDIR
mkdir -p			Create nested directories in a single command. 'p' stands for parent directory
Example:
mkdir -p newdir1/newdir2
mkdir -m 777	Create directory with these permissions ??

MKTEMP
tmp=$(mktemp)		mktemp returns a random temporary file name and creates that file
tmp_dir=$(mktemp -d)	mktemp -d returns a random temporary directory name and creates that directory 

MORE
more <file>
Opens the file for reading. Can for some files display colors, underlines and bold text

PARALLEL
parallel -j<n processors> "<command you want to parallelize> {}" ::: <files to process>

Example:
parallel -j8 "seqret -sequence <(zcat {}) -outseq fasta/{/.}.fasta" ::: ../../data/wgs_*.dat.gz

This command will use 8 processors, so 8 seqret commands will be executed at the same time until all files have been processed.

{}   holds the name of the file, including the path,           for example in this case ../../data/wgs_cevg01_env.dat.gz
{/.} holds the basname of the file, and the extension trimmed, for example in this case wgs_cevg01_env.dat
If you don't provide a number of processors, parallel will take ALL available processors

parallel -j2 < $(JOBS) 	      	    	    	      Where $(JOBS) holds a list of commands to be executed independently
parallel -j2 --halt soon,fail=1 < $(JOBS)	      --halt will prevent any new jobs from being invoked when an error is returned by one of the jobs.
	     	    		  		      Currently running jobs are still finished properly
 


PASTE
paste	Concatenate vertically
-d	Sets delimiter, default=TAB
cat <list> | paste -sd+ | bc	easy code to get the sum of column

PERL -PE (perldoc perlrun)
As a replacement for sed. Perl -PE has a better regular expressions support
-p   assumes the code 'while (<IN>) { ##code## } '
-e   anything within '' will be seen as a perl script

Example:
perl -pe 's:^.+$:TEST: if /^>/' aaa_pooled-hfix.fasta
-i   Changes input file. (Just like sed). But the -i has to be first flag for some reason
-w   use warnings

PDFUNITE
Concatenate PDFs
pdfunite *.pdf out.pdf
or
pdftk *.pdf cat output <new.pdf>

PS
ps		Shows a list of active processes with process IDs (PIDs) and the command used to start these processes
ps -fu $USER  	Shows all actives processes invoked by $USER

PPID: Parent Process ID


READLINK

readlink -f <file.txt>	Returns the absolute path of the file
If realpath is not available

REALPATH

realpath <file.txt>	Returns the absolute path of the file

REBOOT
reboots the system

RSYNC
rsync <option> <source> <destination>
Options:
-a			    Archive mode, keeps all symlinks, devices, attributes, permissions, ownerships etc.
-v			    Verbose mode
-z			    Compress data during transfer
-h			    Human readable output
-P		       	    --progress and --partial combined
--partial		    If transfer breaks, you can restart it no problem later
--progress	   	    Shows progress bars of transfer
--log-file=<file>   	    Creates log of rsync transfer
--delete-after		    Deletes files in the destination that are no long present in the source
-L or --copy-links	    Rsyncs the file that the link is pointed to
-p    			    Preserve permissionsÎ
-u or --update		    Skip files that are newer on the receiver
-r or --recursive	    Tells rsync to copy directories recursively
--exclude='*.txt'	    Rsync all files except for those that end with .txt
--include='*.txt'	    Rsync only files that end with .txt
--files-from=files.txt	    Rsync only the files that are listed in 'files.txt'.
			    Example: rsync --files-from=files.list jmartijn@molev-32-72.icm.uu.se:/path/of/destination/ .
			    Where files.list contained only file names, no paths or slashes etc.
--exclude-from=files.txt    Rsync all files except those listed in files.txt
			    Make sure the filenames in files.txt are relative to <source>, not necessarily from where you execute the command!
--dry-run		    Do a dry-run. Execute a test operation without making any changes
--inplace		    Update destination files in-place. Update file without creating a new file.
			    Without --inplace, rsync would create a new tmp file, copy the updated parts onto it, swap with destination file, delete old copy of destination file
--append		    Append data onto shorter files
			    Append assumes that the destination file is a shorter version of the source file, meaning the destination file is identical to the start of the source file

For updating chain backups, this command is really useful
rsync -avP --inplace --append chain*.* chain_backup/

SCREEN
screen			Open up a new screen
screen -S <sessionname>	Create a new screen with <sessionname>
screen -ls		List down the current open screens
screen -r <screen id>  	Reattach to the screen
screen -r <sessionname>	Reattach to screen with the set sessionname
screen -r 	  	If there is only one screen, it automatically will reattach to that one.
exit   	  	  	Exit the current screen you are in
			(this will kill any processses in this screen?)

SED (ON UNIX)
sed 's/PATTERN/REPLACE/g' <file> > <outfile>
sed 's|PATTERN|REPLACE|g' <file> > <outfile> # any character works as delimiter in sed

If you want to replace a PATTERN expressed as a $STRING, and the $STRING contains '/', use a different delimiter instead.

If sed is used in a for loop with replace as $i, use double quotes:
sed "s/PATTERN/$i/g" or "s/$i/PATTERN/g"

Flags:
-i	Will replace patterns in the input file. Input = output file
sed -n '[number]'p   	      	 Prints line number [number]
sed -n '[number1],[number2]'p 	 Prints lines in range number1-number2
sed -n '[number],$'p		 Prints from line [number] to the end

sed -r 's/(.+)\|(.+)/\2\|\1/'
You have to escape pipes (present in the file) but not the parentheses (have a function here). + only works here with extended regexp (-r)
'>' You dont have to escape though
\d+ does not work with sed. you have to use [0-9]
If you want to replace single quotes, then use double quotes for the whole sed command (so "s///" instead of 's///' )

sed '/^>/! s/U/T/gi' rna.fasta > dna.fasta	Negates any line that starts with '>'
the first argument within the quotes tells sed which lines to look or not look for

Flags
-r	For extended regexp
-E	For extended regexp

sed "s/^$/d" 	     Delete empty lines
sed "s/\_/\t/3"	     Replaces 3rd occurrence of _ in the line with a tab
sed "s/\_/\t/g3"     Replaces 3rd occurrence until last occurrence of _ in the line with a tab

sed "1s/^/foo\n/"    Introduce a new first line that contains "foo"

Tricks
sed -i -r "/^>/ s/_R_// ; s/,/_/" Do two replacements at once
sed -i -r -e "/^>/ s/_R_//" -e "s/,/_/" Same as above

sed -i -r "/^>/! y/acgt/ACGT/" y/// means that each character is replaced separately, kind of like tr (?)

SED (ON MAC OS)
On the Mac there are two flavors of REs for sed. Basic Regular Expressions (BRE) and Extended Regular Expressions (ERE).
But in addition, there is also 'Enhanced BRE' and 'Enhanced ERE'. It's a total mess, this RE world ...
Enhanced allows REs like \s \S \d \D \w \W etc . But apparently these enhanced do not work with Mac OS sed

\s  [[:space:]]
\S  [^[:space:]]

Also quantifiers like + do not work. * Does work.
PCRE = Perl Compatible Regular Expressions

Replace with newlines in MacOS
sed -E 's/£££/\'$'\n/g'
It's important to use single quotes around the entire expression!


SEQ
Creates a sequence of numbers
seq <start> <increment> <end> -s <separator>
seq -w 000 050 500 returns 000 050 100 150 etc. -w ensures that all numbers have the same digit length.

Example:
END=5
seq 0 $END		Returns 0 1 2 3 4 5, separated by <separator>

SIPS
Rotate png / jpg images a certain number of degrees
sips \
	-r <degrees_rotating_clockwise>
	--padColor <color_of_resulting_deadspace> (FFFFFF = white)
	--out <out_file>
If you want to rotate counter clockwise e.g. 10 degrees, simply rotate clockwise 360-10=350 degrees.


SORT
sort -n -t "_" -k 2 <file>	SEPERATES BY "_", PICKS THE 2ND FIELD AND SORTS THAT NUMERICALLY
-r   	       	    		Reverses the sort output (for example instead of large to small go from small to large)
-u -k 1,1  			Omits lines that are copies in the first field after sorting
-g    	   			Sort exponential values
-h	   			Sort human readable numbers, incompatible with -n
-k 1				All fields from field 1 until the last field
-k 1,1				Just field 1

SHUTDOWN
shutdown -r +5 "Rebooting soon, log out ASAP!"		Gives people who are logged in some time to log out.

SPLIT
Split a file by size, by lines or other things
split -l 10000 <myfile> <prefix>				Splits up a file into multiple files with 10000 lines each
split -d <myfile>						Makes numerical suffixes instead of alphabetical
split -n l/<N> <myfile>						Splits file into <N> chunks while not splitting lines

SSH
Login as root:
Type either 'su' and then enter the root password
or
ssh into your own machine as root as follows:
ssh -i .ssh/root_rsa root@molev209
and enter the passphrase for key '.ssh/root_rsa' (not the same as the root password)
ssh -X	  enable X11-forwarding
ssh -Y	  enable trusted X11-forwarding

SVN
cd desired/directory
svn checkout svn://foo DOWNLOADS REPOSITORY, THIS IS ONLY NEEDED TO DO ONCE
Before you can add a new file to the svn, you actually need to physically copy it to the svn folder.
svn add [new dir]
svn add [new file]
svn commit -m "Message to the subversion system DATE"
svn update UDPATES YOUR LOCAL REPOSITORY WITH LATEST CHANGES ON SUBVERSION SYSTEM

TAIL
tail <file>		Shows the last 10 lines of a file
-n <number>		Shows the last [number] lines of a file
-n +<number>		Shows the last part of a file starting at line [number]
-f 			Keeps updating, if the file is being appended continuously

TAR
tar is short for "tape archive"
tar -tvf	Lists the contents of the .tar
tar -ztvf	Lists the contents of the .tar.gz
tar -jtvf	Lists the contents of the .tar.bz2
tar -czvf <new archive name>.tar.gz /path/to/dir-or-file>	(Create) an archive with g(Z)ip, with (V)erbose and specify (F)ilename
tar xzf <tar_ball> -C <output_dir>

TR
tr -s ' '			    If you have multiple white space characters in a row, it will truncate it to just a single white space

tr '\t' '\n'	   	       	    Transform all tab into newlines
tr '[abc]' '[def]' 		    Transform all a's into d's, b's into e's etc.
cat FILE | tr -dc '(' | wc -c	    Counts number of '(' in file
tr -d ' >'    	      	   	    Deletes space ánd >
tr -d '\n'						Removes all newline characters

TIME
time [cmd]	Will print out the time it takes to execute a given command

UNAME
Prints system information
-a     Prints all information

Prints among other stuff, hostname, 32-bit or 64-bit

VI(M)
:x	Quit

W
Shows you who is currently logged in

WGET
wget <source_url> -P <out_dir>


WC 
wc -m 			Prints the number of characters in the entire file

WHATIS 
whatis <command>
Gives a oneline summary of what the <command> is

WHEREIS
whereis <command>
Searches standard unix/linux locations, like /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin, /bin/ etc for <command>

WHICH
which <command>
Searches your $PATH for the executable that is <command> and returns the directori(es) in your $PATH that have said <command>
