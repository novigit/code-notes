# SHELL SCRIPTING #

& LOOP STUFF &

IF LOOP SYNTAX
if []; then
   ...
else
   ...
fi

WHILE READ LOOP
Read a file line by line and assign variables to the line's content.

Example:
ls -la | while read PERM USR USRGRP SIZE; do
   echo $PERM $USR $USRGRP $SIZE;
done

Use the read '-r' flag, 'while read -r STRING' to prevent read from eating '\' in $STRING

LOOP CONTROL
break	Breaks the current loop (analogous to 'next' of Perl?)

LOOP OVER RANGE OF NUMBERS
for i in {89..97..2}; do
    echo $i
done

Will return
89
91
93
95
97

& COMPARING STUFF &

COMPARE TWO STRINGS
if [ "$S" -ge "$Q" ] ...

SHELL BOOLEANS FOR INTEGERS
-eq   Equal
-ne   Not Equal
-gt   Greater Than
-lt   Lesser Than
-ge   Greater or Equal then
-le   Lesser or Equal then

STRING COMPARISON OPERATORS
=     Match
!=    Does not match

Example:
Checks if the string "BACL10" is part of $alphabin

if [[ "$alphabin" != *"BACL10"* ]]; then
   echo "blastp $alphabin ..."
fi

OTHER COMPARISONS
[-e FILE]	True if FILE exists
[-f FILE]	True if FILE exists and is a regular file
[-h FILE]	True if FILE exists and is a symbolic link

& BASH SCRIPT STUFF &
ARGUMENTS FOR BASH SCRIPT
$0	  Name of the bash script
$1	  First argument
$2	  Second argument
$3	  Etc etc..

CASE
Matches a variable against a range of options described in the case loop

Example:
var=apple
case $var in
    apple)
	echo "variable was apple";;
    pear)
	echo "variable was pear";;
    mango)
	echo "variable was mango";;
esac
Will print "variable was apple"

GETOPTS
Stating options in a bash script. Only works with one letter flags.
<take example from script>

& REST STUFF &
USING DELIMITER OTHER THAN WHITESPACE:
grep -c ">" foo.fasta | while IFS=':' do
     echo $FILE $SEQCOUNT;
done

STRING CONTROL
i=teststring
echo $i			returns "teststring"
echo ${i}		returns "teststring"
echo ${i%string}	returns "test"
echo ${i%string}var	returns "testvar"
echo ${i#test}		returns "string"
echo ${i/string/button} returns "testbutton"


PROCESS SUBSTITUTION
join <(sort FILE1) <(sort FILE2) > FILE3
<(sort FILE) obsoletes an intermediate file, it creates like a temporary file within the command.
Otherwise you would have done:
sort FILE1 > FILE1-sort
sort FILE2 > FILE2-sort
join FILE1-sort FILE2-sort > FILE3
rm FILE1-sort
rm FILE2-sort
So it saves you a lot of work! Amazing!!

# UNIX PROGRAMS #

-n	Removes the newline character

FIND
find <PATH> -name <EXPRESSION>
Flags

GREP
grep "PATTERN" <file> OUTPUTS THE ENTIRE LINE OF WHERE IT FINDS ITS HITS
grep -v "^$"   	      REMOVES EMPTY LINES 
     		      (no special character, but clever use
		      of regexp: ^ start of line, $ end of line)
Flags:
-i			Ignores case
-n			REPORTS LINE NUMBER OF HITS
-c			COUNTS HITS
-c ""			Counts lines in the file
-A <int>	       	PRINTS IN ADDITION TO HIT LINE ALSO int LINES AFTER HIT	
-v 		       	PRINTS ALL LINES EXCEPT LINES WITH HITS
-P		       	Allows for Perl regexp in PATTERN
-f <FILE>	       	Prints all lines that have the PATTERNS listed in FILE, one per line
-x 		        The PATTERN must encompass the entire line. Handy for speeding up grep
--no-group-separator	Suppresses the '--' seperator when using -A, -B, or -C
-o			If you have multiple hits in a single line, it will report all the hits on that line, seperated by newlines. 
			It will not report the whole line, but just the match. Hence the name '-only_matching'
--color=always		Keep coloring of match even if you pipe into a new grep command. Even less keeps color
			Can even do 2 different colors. Example
			echo "hello" | grep --color=always "he" | GREP_COLORS="mt=01;34" grep "lo"
-e			Multiple search patterns at the same time. grep -e "pattern1" -e "pattern2"
-m <NUM>		Only reports the first <NUM> lines with match			
-H 			Always reports the filename that it found its hit in

AGREP

HOSTNAME
hostname	Reveals the name of the host
		Example: molev209
JOBS
Lists all 'jobs', that can either be commands, or scripts or anything like that in the background. Putting an '&' sign after the job command puts it in the background. With FG (foreground), you put the 'job' back in the foreground. Then you can kill it for example. JOBS only lists those jobs that are running in that specific terminal

KILL
Killing defunct processes. For example when Firefox crashes
ps -e | grep firefox
kill -9 <process_id_of_firefox>

LESS
/PATTERN
Search for regex pattern in file from this point on forward
?PATTERN

Press 'N' to go the previous hit
<number> then g	    Go to line <number>

Flags:
-S		Show file without line breaks
-N		Show line numbers

LN
Symbolic links
ln -s <source> <link name>	Places a link to another file (so prevents additional space to be used)
ln -s <source> 	     		Automatically clips the path and only leaves the file name as the name of the link

MAN
man -l <file>	Will open the file with man
man ./		Will open the file with man

MKDIR
mkdir -p			Create nested directories in a single command
Example:
mkdir -p newdir1/newdir2

PASTE
paste	Concatenate vertically
-d	Sets delimiter, default=TAB

PERL -PE (perldoc perlrun)
As a replacement for sed. Perl -PE has a better regular expressions support
-p   assumes the code 'while (<IN>) { ##code## } '
-e   anything within '' will be seen as a perl script

Example:
perl -pe 's:^.+$:TEST: if /^>/' aaa_pooled-hfix.fasta
-i   Changes input file. (Just like sed). But the -i has to be first flag for some reason
-w   use warnings

screen -r <screen id>  	Reattach to the screen
screen -r 	  	If there is only one screen, it automatically will reattach to that one.
exit   	  	  	Exit the current screen you are in 
			(this will kill any processses in this screen?)
SED
sed 's/PATTERN/REPLACE/g' <file> > <outfile>
If sed is used in a for loop with replace as $i, use double quotes:
sed "s/PATTERN/$i/g" or "s/$i/PATTERN/g"
Flags:
-i	Will replace patterns in the input file. Input = output file
sed -n '[number]'p   	      	 Prints line number [number]
sed -n '[number1],[number2]'p 	 Prints lines in range number1-number2
sed -n '[number],$'p		 Prints from line [number] to the end

sed -r 's/(.+)\|(.+)/\2\|\1/'
You have to escape pipes (present in the file) but not the parentheses (have a function here). + only works here with extended regexp (-r)
'>' You dont have to escape though
\d+ does not work with sed. you have to use [0-9]
If you want to replace single quotes, then use double quotes for the whole sed command (so "s///" instead of 's///' ) 

sed '/^>/! s/U/T/gi' rna.fasta > dna.fasta	Negates any line that starts with '>'
the first argument within the quotes tells sed which lines to look or not look for

Flags
-r	For extended regexp

sed "s/^$/d" 	     Delete empty lines
sed "s/\_/\t/3"	     Replaces 3rd occurrence of _ in the line with a tab
sed "s/\_/\t/g3"     Replaces 3rd occurrence until last occurrence of _ in the line with a tab

SEQ
Creates a sequence of numbers
seq <start> <increment> <end> -s <separator>

Example:
END=5
seq 0 $END		Returns 0 1 2 3 4 5, separated by <separator>

SORT
sort -n -t "_" -k 2 <file>	SEPERATES BY "_", PICKS THE 2ND FIELD AND SORTS THAT NUMERICALLY
-r   	       	    		Reverses the sort output (for example instead of large to small go from small to large)
-u -k 1,1  			Omits lines that are copies in the first field after sorting
-g    	   			Sort exponential values
-h	   			Sort human readable numbers, incompatible with -n

while in screen
ctrl-a + ctrl-d		Detach from the screen while not interuppting any processes in the screen

SHUTDOWN
shutdown -r +5 "Rebooting soon, log out ASAP!"		Gives people who are logged in some time to log out.

SPLIT
Split a file by size, by lines or other things
split -l 10000 <myfile> <prefix>				Splits up a file into multiple files with 10000 lines each
split -d <myfile>						Makes numerical suffixes instead of alphabetical  
split -n l/<N> <myfile>						Splits file into <N> chunks while not splitting lines

Login as root:
Type either 'su' and then enter the root password
or
ssh into your own machine as root as follows:
ssh -i .ssh/root_rsa root@molev209
and enter the passphrase for key '.ssh/root_rsa' (not the same as the root password)

SVN
cd desired/directory
svn checkout svn://foo DOWNLOADS REPOSITORY, THIS IS ONLY NEEDED TO DO ONCE

svn commit -m "Message to the subversion system DATE"
svn update UDPATES YOUR LOCAL REPOSITORY WITH LATEST CHANGES ON SUBVERSION SYSTEM

TAIL
tail <file>		Shows the last 10 lines of a file
