BESKOW COMMANDS

LOGGING IN
beskow makes use of the Kerberos system.
This means that you use your username and password on your local machine to create a ticket. Then, you use this ticket to login. This way, you will never have to type your password over the internet or on beskow itself.

Create the ticket:
kinit -f jmartijn@NADA.KTH.SE

Check if ticket is valid or expired:
klist -f

If expired:
kinit --renew

Login:
ssh jmartijn@beskow.pdc.kth.se

AVAILABLE SPACE
When you login, you arrive at your home:
/afs/pdc.kth.se/home/j/jmartijn   
(note the '/j/', this is the first letter of your username)

This space is useful for backing up stuff. But files here are can not be accessed by the compute nodes, and therefore cannot be used to run jobs.

To use stuff for jobs, store it at the Lustre file system:
/cfs/klemming/scratch/j/jmartijn and
/cfs/klemming/nobackup/j/jmartijn

Check data usage:
lfs quota -u jmartijn /cfs/klemming

TRANSFERRING FILES TO KLEMMING
Use the node 'cfs-aux-4.pdc.kth.se'.
rsync -avzhP <file(s)_to_transfer> jmartijn@cfs-aux-4.pdc.kth.se:/cfs/klemming/scratch/path/to/location/
# if you use cfs-aux-4.pdc.kth.se you have to include /cfs/klemming/scratch and not /cfs/scratch, because /cfs/scratch does not exist on this node. But /cfs/klemming/scratch and /cfs/scratch are essentially the same directories on the normal login node so its ok.

SETUP A PROFILE
Create a '.bashrc' in the home and edit it the way you like it
