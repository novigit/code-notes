BESKOW COMMANDS

LOGGING IN
beskow makes use of the Kerberos system.
This means that you use your username and password on your local machine to create a ticket. Then, you use this ticket to login. This way, you will never have to type your password over the internet or on beskow itself.

Create the ticket:
kinit -f jmartijn@NADA.KTH.SE

Create a ticket that lasts for 30 days:
kinit -l 30d jmartijn@NADA.KTH.SE

Check if ticket is valid or expired:
klist -f

If expired:
kinit --renew

Delete current tickets:
kdestroy

Login:
ssh jmartijn@beskow.pdc.kth.se

AVAILABLE SPACE
When you login, you arrive at your home:
/afs/pdc.kth.se/home/j/jmartijn   
(note the '/j/', this is the first letter of your username)

This space is useful for backing up stuff. But files here are can not be accessed by the compute nodes, and therefore cannot be used to run jobs.

To use stuff for jobs, store it at the Lustre file system:
/cfs/klemming/scratch/j/jmartijn and
/cfs/klemming/nobackup/j/jmartijn
scratch is regularly wiped, so do not use this one.

Check data usage:
lfs quota -u jmartijn /cfs/klemming

TRANSFERRING FILES TO KLEMMING
Use the node 'tegner.pdc.kth.se'.
rsync -avzhP <file(s)_to_transfer> jmartijn@tegner.kth.se:/cfs/klemming/scratch/path/to/location/
# if you use tegner.pdc.kth.se you have to include /cfs/klemming/scratch and not /cfs/scratch, because /cfs/scratch does not exist on this node. But /cfs/klemming/scratch and /cfs/scratch are essentially the same directories on the normal login node so its ok.

SETUP A PROFILE
Create a '.profile' in the Public folder on the home and put a link in the home called '.profile' to the .profile in the /Public folder. Do not hard reset the PATH in the .profile edit it the way you like it

SLURM COMMANDS

module list				Show all currently loaded modules
module avail				Lists all the software modules available on Beskow
module load <module>			Load module
module unload <module>			Unload module
module purge  				Unload all loaded modules
module keyword <word>       Search all module descriptions for keyword <word>
sbatch -e <out>				Captures the STDERR output
sbatch -o <out>				Captures the STDOUT output
sbatch -n <number>			Set number of cores to use
sbatch -t <days-hours:min:seconds>	Set time limit
sbatch -VALUES              Check sbatch version
scancel <jobid>				Cancels job with <jobid>
projinfo				Summary of used hours last couple of months
projinfo -v -d 				Detailed usage per user
kpasswd	    			 	Change password 
squeue -u jmartijn		       	Check the job queue and estimated start time of your jobs or how long it has been running
squeue -u jmartijn -O "reason:40"	Check the reason why your job has not started running yet
sacct  	  	      			Alternative to squeue, more clearly states status of submitted jobs (CANCELLED and PENDING)
sacct --format "JobID,JobName%30"	Prints up to 30 characters of your submitted jobnames
seff <jobid>                Shows amongst others runtime, CPU efficiency, memory utilized etc

PRINT JOB HISTORY
sacct -S YYYY-MM-DD -u jmartijn --format=User,JobID,Jobname,partition,state,time,start,end,elapsed,MaxRss,MaxVMSize,nnodes,ncpus,nodelist
-S / --starttime
-E / --endtime

COMMON ERRORS
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested node configuration is not available
Some users experience this error when using "#SBATCH -n <number>".
Use this instead:
#SBATCH --nodes=<number/32>
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=32

Unable to negotiate a key exchange method
Simply make a new ticket and try to login again

REASONS
AssocGrpCPURunMinsLimit			Running this job would put the userâ€™s group beyond its maximum number of CPU minutes allocated to currently running jobs
Resources				The job is waiting for resources to become available

DIFFERENT COMPUTER CLUSTERS
Be aware that different clusters can run different versions of SLURM.
Beskow runs 19.05.7, while Graham runs 20.02.4

VIEWING IMAGE FILES
For some reason, 'eog' does not work very nicely on beskow. Therefore, mount /cfs/klemming on local machine with sshfs. Note that this can only be done while you have a valid ticket.

sshfs jmartijn@beskow.pdc.kth.se:/cfs/klemming/nobackup/j/jmartijn/ mount/

Then you can access and read/view all files with programs installed on your local machine. Awesome!

POST-PROCESSING OF BIG JOBS
This should preferably be done on Tegner. Tegner has R installed, whereas Beskow has not.
