OVERVIEW OF GIT COMMANDS AND GENERAL BITBUCKET METHODOLOGY

GIT CONCEPT
GIT is a decentralized versioning system. 
You can make changes locally to cloned copy of the repository, and commit these changes to the online repository.
This can be either github or bitbucket or some other git system.
When committing, git makes a "snapshot" of how your local repository looks like and stores that.

GIT EXAMPLE
Lets say you want to make a modification to a script.
You don't want to disturb the master branch with faulty scripts, so therefore you make a new branch, "issue1" for example.
While in this branch, you make the modification. And now you want to store that modification:
      git add <modified file>
After this you can choose to modify more files, or you can make a commit:
      git commit -m "made change to <file>"
You can make commits offline. Once you are online again, you can push the commits to bitbucket or github as follows
      git push origin <branch>
Enter your account and password, and then it should be done!

GIT COMMANDS
git init					Initiate a local git repository
git config --global user.name "Joran Martijn"
git config --global user.email joran.martijn@icm.uu.se
git config -l					Some general configuration information of account and repository
git clone https://github.com/novigit/brocode	"Clone" the repository to current directory
git status					Check what has been changed since last udpate
git add <file|dir>				"Stage" files for commit, or "add" files to the "staging area", where files are tracked
git add .					Adds all changed files for commit
git diff <file>					Check the changes of a file, between when it was added and now
    	 					Enters 'less'
git commit -m "commit message"			"Commit" the files to your repository
git commit -a -m "commit message"		Will automatically add all tracked files with changes. Will not add untracked files
git log	 					Check your commit log
git remote -v					Lists remote repositories
git checkout <branch>				Change to a specific branch
git push origin master				"Push" changes into repository
git fetch origin master				Downloads the latest master branch to the branch origin/master
git pull origin master				Fetch ánd merge the current master branch with your local copy
    	 					"Origin" refers to the bitbucket server
git branch -v					Shows the local branches and which branch you are on
git branch <branchname>				Create new branch with <branchname>
git --version					Shows current version of git

GENERAL COMMIT "PIPELINE"
1. Make a modification to a <file>
2. git add <file>
3. git commit -m "<message>"
4. git push origin <master|branch>

BITBUCKET
Bitbucket is a repository system where people can share their code and work collectively on code at the same time using a git versioning system.
Bitbucket, unlike github also has the option to keep code hidden, which is why we are using it. 
We don't want people to steal our code and publish before us!! :P

SOME BITBUCKET CONCEPTS
branches			People can make new branches in the project.
				This will prevent potentially breaking the "stable" code, which should be in the master branch
merging branches		After your branch is done and you want to incorporate it to the master branch,
				it is possible to merge your branch with the master branch.
				After that, your branch will still exist however. 
				You need to close the branch manually if you want.
closing branches		The terminology for deleting a branch
forking				Can be synonymous to "branching", but also it can mean to fork the entire repository.
issues				Every time you want to make a modification to your code, you should make an "issue"
				Each consecutive issues gets a number. Starting with issue #1, then #2 etc.
				If you believe your issue is resolved, type "fix #<issue number>" in your commit message.
				For example, commit -m "script is now working fix #45"
				Then bitbucket will mark the issue as "resolved"

CREATING ISSUES
1.	 Create an issue on the bitbucket project page and write some description of what you want to do with the code
2.	 Create a branch on the website as well and use the "git fetch && git checkout <branchname>" command on your pc to switch to this branch. <branchname> should be something like 'issue<issuenumber>'
3.	 Now you are on the branch <branchname>. Work on your code.
4.	 Once code is done, do a 'git pull origin <branchname>' to make sure no other edits have been made that can give conflicts
5.	 Then do 'git add' 'git commit' and 'git push'.

In case you write a new code, also make a git issue. 
Some people might see your issue name on email and may have suggestions on how to do what you want to do in a more efficient way or if another tools is already available. 
Will save you a lot of time

6.   	  Once the issue is resolved, do a final commit that contains "Fix#<issuenumber>" in the commit message. Bitbucket will interpret this and close the issue.
7.	  Merge with master
8.	  Delete branch
