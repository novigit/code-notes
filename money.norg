* Origins of money
  - barter

  - quantifying value
  - medium of exchange
  - store of value

  /Ideas/
  - gold is great because
  -- easily casted into standardized coins
  --- portable, which makes it a practical medium of exchange
  --- small, standardized coins makes things practical to quantify value of things
  -- easily recognizable yet hard to fake (only gold has this orange yellow sheen)
  -- doesn't degrade, which makes it an excellent store of value
  --- think jewelry accumulation in spartan by women
  -- rare but not too rare
  -- stable, only slightly increasing quantity over time, which ensures fairly stable value over time
