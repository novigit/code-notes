GIT

GIT is a decentralized versioning system.


# File Management

```sh
# undo all changes that were made to a file since the last commit
git restore <file>
```

# Branch Management

```sh

# show branches in a simple list
git branch -l  # local
git branch -r  # remote
git branch -a  # all
git branch -v  # verbose
git branch -vv # more verbose

# create new branch with <branchname>
git branch <branchname>

# create a new branch and immediately checkout to it
git checkout -b <branchname>
git switch -c <branchname> # since git 2.23

# delete <branch>
git branch -d <branch>

# check what branches are available on the remote
git ls-remote --heads origin
git remote show origin

# update your local repo's "knowledge" of remote branches
git fetch origin

# create and switch to new local copy of remote branch
git switch <branchname>

# fetch branch from remote
git fetch origin <branch_name>:<branch_name>
```

## Create a new branch and push it to the remote

```sh
# on your local repo do
git switch -c <topic_branch>

# create your changes, and then do
git add <changed_file>

# commit the changes
git commit -m "commit message"

# then push to origin
git push origin <topic_branch>
```

## Update your featurebranch with the latest changes in the main/other branch

```sh
# update our main branch with the remote main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# update our feature branch with the remote feature branch
git checkout feature_branch
git pull origin feature_branch

# fix any conflicts if there are any

# merge into the feature branch,
# make sure you are in the feature branch
# with git branch -v
git merge main

# this will create a merge commit in the feature branch,
# but not in the main branch
```

# Various Snippets

```sh
# check the changes in a particular commit
git show HEAD
git show 081870e

# change the commit message of the last commit, if you haven't pushed it to the remote yet
git commit --amend -m "new commit message"

# show git diff with colors in less
git diff --color=always <file> | less -R

# show the git diff of the same file in different branches
# while in 'main'
git diff <other_branch> <path/to/file>

# undo an accidental git add
git reset <FILE>

# delete the latest commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

# Setting up your GitHub SSH-key
```
# generate a private/public key pair
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "joranmartyn@gmail.com"

# save as '~/.ssh/github_ed25519'

# nevermind a passphrase

# edit your '~/.ssh/config'
Host github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_ed25519
    HostName github.com

# now copy the exact contents of '~/.ssh/github_ed25519.pub'
# (the public key) onto your GitHub account

# Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> New SSH key -> Add a title -> Paste the public key -> Add SSH key

# in your known_hosts, make sure you have
