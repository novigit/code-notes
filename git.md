GIT

GIT is a decentralized versioning system.

```sh
# check the changes in a particular commit
git show HEAD
git show 081870e

# change the commit message of the last commit, if you haven't pushed it to the remote yet
git commit --amend -m "new commit message"

# show git diff with colors in less
git diff --color=always <file> | less -R

# show the git diff of the same file in different branches
# while in 'main'
git diff <other_branch> <path/to/file>

# undo an accidental git add
git reset <FILE>
```

#### Branch Management
```sh
# show the local branches and which branch you are on
git branch -v

# create new branch with <branchname>
git branch <branchname>

# create a new branch and immediately checkout to it
git checkout -b <branchname>

# delete <branch>
git branch -d <branch>
```

#### Setting up your GitHub SSH-key
```
# generate a private/public key pair
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "joranmartyn@gmail.com"

# save as '~/.ssh/github_ed25519'

# nevermind a passphrase

# edit your '~/.ssh/config'
Host github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_ed25519
    HostName github.com

# now copy the exact contents of '~/.ssh/github_ed25519.pub'
# (the public key) onto your GitHub account

# Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> New SSH key -> Add a title -> Paste the public key -> Add SSH key

# in your known_hosts, make sure you have
